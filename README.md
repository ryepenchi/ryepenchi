### Welchome

I'm a BSc Geography student (Specialisation Cartography and Geoinformatics) at the University of Vienna. I make scripts, scrapers, little games, web-apps but really anything teaching myself to code. 

Iâ€™m currently working on and learning by doing: [wherethenews](#https://github.com/ryepenchi/wherethenews)
A Web-App using a Python web scraper in the background as well as a Flask / Leaflet Website at the front. 
It shows you the places that were in the news recently on a map!
